Hello there, I'm Cass Python, also known by my online name of Owly - welcome to my git, hope you like it here! Why not take a look around at my repositories? I'm sure there will be something that will catch your eye.

I have a strong interest in digital preservation and because of this, a lot of my repositories that you will find on here are mirrors of other people and my own work.

I'm a big nerd when it comes to things relating to the world of ICT and outdated tech is my jam, same goes for things like websites from the 1990s.

When I'm not drooling over terribly made websites, I like to also be a nerd for other rubbish from Red Dwarf, bands like Oingo Boingo and The Beatles, plus annoying my friends over on at Discord (add me: **Owly#6604**).

I am also currently learning Esperanto as a second language, so that's something, I guess.
